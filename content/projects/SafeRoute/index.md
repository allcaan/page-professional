Project Description (English)
Our project develops a community-driven safety map platform that combines public data with real-time reports from local residents. By applying AI-based classification and risk assessment, the platform provides intuitive visualizations of crime-prone areas, disaster risks, and safety concerns. This helps municipalities, schools, and residential communities to strengthen their safety networks, make informed decisions, and create a safer living environment for everyone.
