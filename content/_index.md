        We’re a small, cross-functional team. We use competitions and hackathons as a proving ground to rapidly validate ideas and ship working results. From product fabrication to AI-driven services and brand/UX/UI, we handle end-to-end delivery with tight loops—problem framing, research, prototyping, field testing, and refinement.
